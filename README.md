# Pascals Triangle as a Galton Board

Visual proof that each number in Pascal's Triangle represents the number of paths to that location, using a model of a [Galton Board or "bean machine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine) to demonstrate. See a discussion and demonstration in [this Mechanical Scribe post](http://mechanicalscribe.com/notes/pascals-triangle-paths/).

# Usage
Just open [demo.html](demo.html). You don't even need to run a server! Then hit "Start."

# Parameter
Too slow? You can set the parameters [here](https://github.com/wilson428/pascals-triangle-paths/blob/master/galton.js#L23) and reduce the timing of the ball drops or randomize the order of the paths.
